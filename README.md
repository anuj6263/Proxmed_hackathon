# Model for 2nd Proxmed LPU-Hackathon Project

## Dependencies

In requirements.txt file

## To run this project

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open Google Colab as the IDE, (Kaggle and Jupyter also works, but will have to make some changes).
3. All the folder structure is maintained, so you don't have change the files.
4. Execute all lines of code and the model will be saved in your Drive/local computer.
5. For reference the model has been shared in model_h5_file.txt
6. By default the prediction has been done for all the NCCT images, i.e in the last output you'll see the mask for every NCCT Image.
7. To make prediction, in the last segment of the code, change the file path to the NCCT Image you'll provide to the model, the label can be any random file of ROI and it doesn't have any effect on the Output.
